# React Native Game-of-Life App

This is a simple React Native project in which I aim to learn React, Native, and TypeScript. 

I aim to deploy it on both Android and iOS, although Android testing will only be done in an emulator and iOS testing will be limited as I do not own a Mac, although I will run it in a VM.
